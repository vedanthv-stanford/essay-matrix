# Logo Caching Solution

This document explains how the logo caching system works to prevent hitting API limits when viewing the colleges page.

## Problem

Previously, every time you visited the colleges page, the system would:
1. Call the logo.dev API for each college logo
2. Use a cache-busting parameter (`_t: Date.now()`) that prevented any caching
3. Hit API rate limits quickly with repeated visits

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive caching solution with multiple layers:

### 1. Client-Side Caching (localStorage)

- **Duration**: 7 days
- **Storage**: Base64 encoded images stored in localStorage
- **Key Format**: `college_logo_cache_{college_name}_{size}_{highQuality}`
- **Benefits**: 
  - No API calls for cached logos
  - Instant loading of previously viewed logos
  - Works across browser sessions

### 2. Server-Side Caching

- **Duration**: 24 hours (in-memory)
- **Storage**: Node.js Map object
- **Benefits**: 
  - Reduces calls to logo.dev API
  - Faster response times for repeated requests
  - Shared across all users

### 3. HTTP Caching Headers

- **Cache-Control**: `public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800`
- **Duration**: 24 hours with 7-day stale-while-revalidate
- **Benefits**: 
  - Browser-level caching
  - CDN caching support
  - Reduced server load

## How It Works

### First Visit
1. User visits colleges page
2. System checks localStorage for cached logos
3. For uncached logos, makes API call to `/api/logo`
4. Server checks in-memory cache
5. If not cached, calls logo.dev API
6. Logo is cached at all levels (localStorage, server, HTTP headers)

### Subsequent Visits
1. User visits colleges page again
2. System finds cached logos in localStorage
3. Logos display instantly without API calls
4. No impact on API rate limits

## Cache Management

### Automatic Cleanup
- Expired cache entries are automatically removed
- localStorage entries older than 7 days are cleaned up
- Server cache entries older than 24 hours are removed

### Manual Cache Control
Use the `CacheManager` component to:
- View current cache statistics
- Clear all cached logos manually
- Force fresh logo fetches

## Implementation Details

### CollegeLogo Component
```tsx
// Check cache first
const cacheKey = `college_logo_cache_${collegeName.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_')}_${size}_${highQuality}`;
const cached = localStorage.getItem(cacheKey);
if (cached) {
  // Use cached logo
  return;
}
// Fetch from API and cache
```

### Logo API Route
```tsx
// Check server cache
const cachedLogo = getCachedLogo(cacheKey);
if (cachedLogo) {
  return cachedLogo;
}
// Fetch from logo.dev and cache
```

## Benefits

1. **API Rate Limit Protection**: Logos are only fetched once per college per 7 days
2. **Improved Performance**: Cached logos load instantly
3. **Better User Experience**: No loading states for previously viewed logos
4. **Cost Reduction**: Significantly fewer API calls to logo.dev
5. **Offline Support**: Cached logos work even without internet connection

## Monitoring

Check the browser console for cache-related logs:
- `[CollegeLogo] Using cached logo for {college}`
- `[CollegeLogo] Fetching logo from API: {url}`
- `[Logo API] Using cached logo data for {college}`
- `[Logo API] X-Cache: HIT/MISS` headers

## Cache Statistics

The `CacheManager` component shows:
- Total cached logos
- Cache clearing functionality
- Real-time cache status

## Troubleshooting

### If logos aren't caching:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage is enabled
3. Check if cache keys are being generated correctly

### If you need fresh logos:
1. Use the "Clear Logo Cache" button
2. Wait for cache expiration (7 days)
3. Check if logo.dev API is working

### If hitting API limits:
1. Ensure caching is working properly
2. Check server logs for cache hits/misses
3. Verify cache duration settings

## Future Improvements

1. **Progressive Caching**: Cache logos at different sizes
2. **Background Preloading**: Preload logos for popular colleges
3. **Cache Compression**: Compress cached images to save storage
4. **Cache Analytics**: Track cache hit rates and performance
5. **Smart Prefetching**: Predict which logos users will need
